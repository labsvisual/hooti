# Introduction
Hey! I hope I am not intruding, but I was really excited to see the project
you talked about when we met.

I have taken the liberty to modify the code just a little bit to make sure
everything is perfect for your first, awesome project! :D

Don't worry - there are no breaking changes; the modifications pertain, primarily,
to code styles and some performance improvements.

Contact me if you need any further help with this.
